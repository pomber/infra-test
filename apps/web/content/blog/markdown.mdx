This is how markdown is usually used:

```js
import { frontmatter, Content } from "./some.md"
```

One of the reasons why markdown has so good authoring experience is because of its focus on content, as oppose to presentation.

This suits linear layouts, but it's not enough for more complex layouts. For more complex layouts we need to group pieces of content in sections, and put those sections in a hierarchy.
