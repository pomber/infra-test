Let's tart with an example.

> demo (roman emperors)

This is a UI pattern commonly referred as scrollytelling, where the content is presented in a way that is tightly coupled with the user's scroll position.

You may have seen it in websites like [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/30/opinion/covid-vaccine-inequality.html), or [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/).

It's also used for technical content like [Stripe's API reference](https://stripe.com/docs/api) or [React's documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

A component to implement this pattern is not super hard to build, usually it's a combination of an intersection observer and position sticky.

```tsx
type Props = {
  steps: {
    content: React.ReactNode
    sticker: React.ReactNode
  }[]
}
function Scrollytelling({ steps }: Props) {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0)
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      ([entry]) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          setCurrentStep(parseInt(entry.target.id))
        }
      },
      { threshold: 0.5 },
    )

    steps.forEach((_, i) => {
      observer.observe(document.getElementById(i.toString())!)
    })

    return () => observer.disconnect()
  }, [])

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      {steps.map((step, i) => (
        <div key={i} id={i.toString()}>
          {step.content}
        </div>
      ))}
      <div style={{ position: "sticky", top: 0 }}>
        {steps[currentStep].sticker}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Using this component is as simple as passing an array of steps, each with a content and a sticker.

```tsx page.tsx
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Scrollytelling
      steps={[
        {
          content: (
            <div>
              <h1>Augustus</h1>
              <p>
                Augustus was the first Roman emperor, reigning from 27 BC until
                his death in AD 14.
              </p>
            </div>
          ),
          sticker: <img src="/augustus.jpg" alt="Augustus" />,
        },
        {
          content: (
            <div>
              <h1>Nero</h1>
              <p>
                Nero was the last Roman emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.
              </p>
            </div>
          ),
          sticker: <img src="/nero.jpg" alt="Nero" />,
        },
        {
          content: (
            <div>
              <h1>Trajan</h1>
              <p>Trajan was Roman emperor from 98 to 117.</p>
            </div>
          ),
          sticker: <img src="/trajan.jpg" alt="Trajan" />,
        },
      ]}
    />
  )
}
```

Even with this simple example, you can see that writing content in this way isn't vert straightforward.

Ideally, you would want to put the content in Markdown like this:

```md
## Augustus

Augustus was the first Roman emperor, reigning from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.

![Augustus](/augustus.jpg)

## Nero

Nero was the last Roman emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

![Nero](/nero.jpg)

## Trajan

Trajan was Roman emperor from 98 to 117.

![Trajan](/trajan.jpg)
```
