I ([@pomber](https://github.com/pomber)) am working full-time on this project. The official reason is that _I want to raise the bar on the formatting of technical content_, but the main reason is that I'm having a lot of fun building it.

The goal of [Code Hike](https://codehike.org) is to provide the best experience for both authors and consumers of technical content on the web.
